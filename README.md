# proxonWOT
This is a WebOfThings compliant implementation for the Modbus interface of the Proxon FWT (https://www.zimmermann-lueftung.de/komforttechnik/die-proxon-geraete/proxon-fwt-serie-zentralgeraet). It allows to read and write the values (Temperatures, Fans, ...) accessible by Modbus.

It is required to have a working serial Modbus connection to the Proxon in place. This can be achieved via a simple RS232 to USB Adapter.
